	* Python 3.10+
	* Tensorflow
	* Numpy
	* Opencv-python

* To run the python version of the code :
```sh
python3 FaceTracker.py
```
* Then you can find  faces extracted stored in the floder **./facepics** .
## What can this project do?

* You can run it to extract the optimal face for everyone from a lot of videos and use it as a training set later on in future projects.
* You can also send the extracted face to the backend for **Face Recognition**.
