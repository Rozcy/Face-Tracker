Face Detection & Tracking

This project can detect , track and extract the optimal face in multi-target faces (including side face).

Introduction
Dependencies:
Python 3.10+
Tensorflow
Numpy
Opencv-python

Run
To run the python version of the code :
python3 FaceTracker.py
Then you can find faces extracted stored in the floder ./facepics .
If you want to draw 5 face landmarks on the face extracted,you just add the argument face_landmarks
python3 start.py --face_landmarks
What can this project do?
You can run it to extract the optimal face for everyone from a lot of videos and use it as a training set later on in future projects.
You can also send the extracted face to the backend for Face Recognition.
Results
[Will be added later]
